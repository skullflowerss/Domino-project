  <h1>Domino project</h1>
  <p>Sup, again, now, reading about images and dominos, I wanted to make a little something
    is like the first "tile project", but with dominos. The sets are from 9.
  </p>
  <h2>Instructions, use, whatever</h2>
	<p>Its really easy to use, you just need to upload a picture, select the size of the tile and the order of them
	then you can right click the image and save it.
	</p>
  <h3>dont forget </h3>
  <p>the bowser is going to take a little bit of time is the image is too big.</p>
